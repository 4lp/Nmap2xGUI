# Nmap2xGUI

This is an old program I wrote while working IT to help our account managers better document the environments they supported. It takes an
XML file generated by Nmap and outputs each device's hostname and IP address in MoinMoin table format (although the next step 
is to add support for csv, tsv, etc.) Some of the admins were afraid of command line utils, so I had to make it GUI-based. 

# Todo

-add batch support
-add csv and tsv support
-add support for other file formats (?)
